# Step 3: What&#x27;s next?

You've just learned the very basics of how to use C++ within NodeJS. There's a lot more to learn when it comes to building an add-on, and I'm not just talking about learning v8 and Nan's API. Think about the possibilities, the C++ community have been developed for years and there are so much great libraries out there that are not necessarily relevant to NodeJS due to its efficiency, like [Boost](http://www.boost.org/), [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org/) and many more.

This tutorial didn't focus about algorithmics obviously, it's a good starting point though, because from here I can take it to wherever I want, but I won't reveal my future plans in due course. Hopefully you liked it, stay tuned for upcoming tutorials about this topic.
